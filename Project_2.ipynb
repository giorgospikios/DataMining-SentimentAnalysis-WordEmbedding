      "After arriving hours later than intended, Mary was patiently waiting in the apartment to greet us. She was very friendly and helpful, and had a packet prepared of all different information that we would require for our weekend stay (maps, metro, tourist info, local eats, a taxi contact, etc). I was a bit nervous about the area at first, but the apartment is in a quiet neighborhood away from the dodgier parts of Metaxourgio/Kolonos. The only complaint we had is when we returned back the first night, we found 2 cockroaches, but I blamed that on the fact that the window in the kitchen had been left open. After closing the window, we had not one problem for the remainder of our trip! And truly, apart from that, the apartment was very clean! Leandros and Mary had left us with fresh sheets, towels and even small soaps!  And all the amenities the apartment provided were excellent  (AC, WiFi, hairdryer, kitchen appliances...).\n",
      "The apartment is also a very short walk from Tram #12 which quickly takes you to the center of Athens, which was very convenient for us doing all the touristy things. \n",
      "All and all, my entire group (4 people) felt that apartment was great! It was spacious, clean, conveniently close to center - and provided everything we needed to have an easy and enjoyable trip to Athens!\n",
      "Leandros place was exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for not being in a hotel, not in a tourist spot, nothing fancy, but being in a straight Athens neighbourhood. As much as you can hope for in a short stay, we felt connected to Athenean life. All essentials were supplied in the appartment, like sugar, salt, spices, coffee, towels, butter, soap, shampoo,...Two supermarket are close and bus #12 took us to the center.\n",
      "Leandros was always available for help or questions, by e-mail or phone. I felt very welcomed and all in all I was very pleased with my stay.. I might just go there again. If you don't expect anything fancy, but something down-to-earth, I highly recommend the place.\n",
      "Everything about this rental is perfect !\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment is perfect, as is the host and the location.\n",
      "\n",

      "Fabulous apartment.  I chose it because I read all of the 70 plus mostly positive reviews so I knew I was on to a good thing.  Took advantage of Yannis arranging taxi to meet us and then later return us to the airport (at 4:00 am).  This time there was a different host at our arrival.  Not Yannis, not George, but Christina.  Once again, a helpful and caring reception on arrival.  Everything in the apartment met our expectations, a really nice place.\n",

      "Stayed two weeks.  Many good eateries right below us on  Varnava Square.  No problem walking to the Acropolis (15-20 minutes). There's a #209 bus in the square or a short 3 block walk gets you to a spot where you can take a #2, #4, or#11 bus downtown.  A bus ticket good for 70 minutes costs 1.2 euro, or .6 euro if you're a senior.  Very safe area, walk in any direction without worry.\n",

      "Yannis was a great host! He was very quick to reply with our many questions. He was very flexible and prompt at our arrival and assisted us in getting a taxi to the airport at departure time. The neighborhood where the apartment is located is so lovely. It is close enough to take a 5€- 10 € taxi into downtown Athens, and other tourist attractions, which is nice (trust that in Athenian heat, you will want to take an AC taxi). However I found what made this little neighborhood so great was that it wasn't too close to the hustle and bustle of the city. It is such a peaceful, quiet yet lively neighborhood. The locals gather around the \"square\" for dinner, coffee, and drinks until late into the night. On our last night we had a late night dinner on the square, the square is just so whimsical and charming, we really wished we could have a place like it back home. I would absolutely recommend this Airbnb if relaxing and slowing down is on your vacation agenda in Athens, it was definitely on ours!  Tip #1. There is a falafel cafe around the corner of the apartment called babaganoosh. Go to it. Eat it as often as possible, it is incredibly delicious! Tip #2. Athenians don't really eat breakfast so don't go to the cafes in the morning asking for a breakfast menu, nobody has food or opens up until after 12pm.  I suggest that you go to the store across the street and stock up on some breakfast goods so you don't have to resort to coffee and toast (unless that's your thing). Tip #3. I know I keep raving about the neighborhood and the square but I'm serious! Hanging out, just downstairs  from your apartment was my favorite! It's so nice to have a home base where you can eat, drink and enjoy it all outdoors. Yamas! \n",
      "We loved this place. Close to city center, shopping, grocery and restaurants. The only thing was the listing didn't post the street #. They were there to greet us with instructions. \n",
      "We had an amazing time in Live in Athens #01. The apartment great  with stunning views of the Acropolis. It's in a great location! Really close to lots of lovely bars and cafes and the main sights. Andreas and Adonis were great hosts. Highly recommended!\n",
      "Our stay in both #1 and #4 was really confortable. #1 offers a terrific view of the Acropolis, which is the highlight of the appartment, whereas the design of the #4 is unique, and also with astonishing views of the nice Exarhia graffiti and vagely beyond, the Hefestos temple.\n",
      "We had a great stay at Live in Athens #01 -- couldn't have asked for more, and the view was absolutely amazing. I'd have no hesitation in recommending the place to anyone!\n",
      "We spent two wonderful nights in Athens just after our arrival from New York - an 8 hour overnight flight. We were pretty tired and jet-lagged but\n",
      "the apartment  was easy to find - a short walk from the metro stop, which was a convenient way to get from the airport into town. In the city, Acropolis #01 was well situated and we were able to walk everywhere. The apartment was completely comfortable and, of course, the view was outstanding. We'll return to Athens at the end of our stay in Greece and look forward to spending 9 more nights with the Live in Athens team.\n",
      "Fantastic, perfect and brilliant! That's what we felt after staying in his comfy and beautiful apartment. First of all, Pygmalion waited us until midnight because the ferry arrived so late at 12:15. Pygmalion waited us patiently and when we arrived in his place, he gave us very thorough info about the location, the transport and the attractions etc. We felt so sorry for keeping him waiting for so long, but Pygmalion was very nice. Then, about the place itself. It was clean, bright and dreamy. I would say that is what we dreamt of. I went to six airbnb this time, and without doubt, this place ranked #1 among them. The kitchen utensils are very good. We can find everything we need in the kitchen. The house also equipped with washing machine and air-conditioner, which helped a lot particularly in such a scorching weather in Europe. This experience was unforgettable. We feel like this place a \"home\", not just a \"place to stay\", which is why we wanted to rent it for a long time or even wanted to buy it. Additionally, the surroundings have two big supermarkets, a metro station, many restaurants and so on. XOM is what Pygmalion recommended. This restaurant was PERFECT with good food at low price!!! I will definitely go to this place next time and I will also 100% recommend it to anyone. Please remember, where you live while travelling makes a great difference--this is golden rule to me. \n",
      "We decided very last-minute to go to Greece over the Easter holidays. Our first time in Athens... first time using Airbnb... a lot of unknowns, and barely 24 hours to arrange it all. After browsing the Airbnb site for a while, I found myself drawn to Ilias's place based on a combination of the photos, description and reviews. We're a family of 4 (kids aged 9 and 12).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ilias responded to my numerous queries virtually immediately. This continued throughout our 5-day stay, from reassuring me that we had not cracked the glass in the front door (it was a preexisting condition), to giving advice about day trips from Athens. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ilias arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the airport. Since he was away for the holidays, he had his father Nikos meet us at the house. Nikos was wonderfully friendly and helpful. He walked us through the neighbourhood (late on Saturday night) looking for a place to eat. Because of Easter, most places were closed, so Nikos contacted Ilias for a suggestion, then drove us in his car to a taverna that was open. It was excellent (and walking distance back to the house). \n",
      "\n",
      "The house is in a residential area -- an easy walk (10-15 min) to the Acropolis Museum and ancient sites. It was really nice to return to a non-touristy neighbourhood each day. People were remarkably friendly, we felt safe, we marveled at the heavily laden orange trees lining the urban streets. We had some excellent meals at restaurants nearby. \n",
      "\n",
      "The house is spacious, comfortable, and well-equipped. With the windows and shutters closed at night (the weather was cool in April) it was very easy to sleep. Granted, Athens empties out over Easter, so maybe it was quieter than usual. While Ilias allows smoking (a detail that I only noticed after making the booking), the house itself didn't smell smoky at all, which was a relief to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "One caution: NOTHING extra can be flushed down the toilet (there's a bin to throw paper into). If you are not wiling to negotiate a delicate toilet, this might not be your ideal place! \n",
      "\n",
      "One regret: we wish we'd had more time with Ilias! We met him only when we departed -- he came by at 6am to meet us and get the keys. What an effusive greeting -- a great way to start the day! An added extra: he gave us 2 tickets for the #15 bus (trolley) that stops down the block and connects to the Petralona metro station, to go to Piraeus port.\n",
      "\n",
      "So overall I highly recommend By the Hill. Perhaps it's not for everyone--see plumbing note above--but if you want to meet some great people, enjoy a comfortable home, and feel like you're getting a glimpse of Athenians' Athens and not just the tourist circuit, this is a super option.\n",
      "We had the best time ever in Athens, most of it cause Fotis Penthouse. It  is breathe taking ! It's more beautiful than the pictures show ! Fotis is a sweet nice host , prepared everything for us, even a local cel phone . Beautiful decoration , clean , all the most modern devices , LCD tvs , air conditioner , beautiful details. And what a view !!! I will recommend to my friends and family and I am going back for sure . Thank you so much Fotis !!! #youarethebest\n",
      "Great location - walking distance to the Acropolis, Plaka, Monastiraki and Syntagma Square, we never needed to take the bus or subway. We gave Dimitris our flight # and he tracked our flight when it was delayed and met us at the apartment at 1am with all the info we needed for our stay and some raki! Anything we needed, Dimitris was happy to provide like directions to the ferry port for the Greek Islands and places to eat.\n",
      "I spent 2 weeks in December in this spacious well equipped appartment. Alex wasvery helpful in accomodating my busy schedule at arrival and departure and also for any other questions I had. (...or helped me to recover some forgotten gadgets)\n",
      "The flat is indeed in easy walking distance from the center (all downhill)  and if tired after a busy day, trolly #4 gets you almost directly to the front door. \n",
      "Great value for a very reasonable price. I can only recommend booking adn hope you enjoy your stay in Athens as I did.\n",
      "We didn't meet Alexandros, but his mom welcomed us. The apartment looks exactly like the pics, and quiet yet close enough to 2 avenues. The area is safe and full with nearby options (cafes & food, supermarkets, ATMs), 1 block from bus #4, 20-30 mins away from Syntagma and Acropolis (just as advertised). Recommended!\n",
      "Rio is a wonderful and warm host! This dreamy studio apartment with a mezzanine  bedroom had everything needed to make us feel at home. 10 minutes from the Acropolis and into the heart of Athens, we only wish we could have stayed another night but the room was all booked up! Satisfaction #10\n",
      "I actually stayed in Live in Athens #03, which is located in the first floor of the same building as #04, but much bigger. \n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed my stay there. The neighbourhood of Psiri, where the flat is located, is funky, arty and great if you want to explore the good life Athens has to offer. The building is in a quite street however. Even though bars and cafés are just around the corner, I could confortably go to sleep in a beautiful bedroom. The appartment itself is decorated in a retrostyle, which really makes it feel like a home and not a hotel. It is cosy and warm and has all you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hosts of Living in Athens were quick to respond to all my questions in advance and truely welcomed my and gave ideas for places to go. I felt very welcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "The layout of the building is a bid out of the ordinary, so I would suggest you have a look at the floor plan that is provided in the ad to get an idea of how the place looks like, particularly for the smaller appartment #04 on the top floor. \n",
      "My stay in apartment #04 was great. Andreas and the other hosts were really nice and helpful. The apartment was very nice and clean and had all the comfort you need (wifi, television, washing machine, kitchen). It had a kind of 'Cycladic look', while outside you face the crowded square of Psiri, the narrow streets with live rembetica music and the wonderful murals of Vasmoulakis and Same84. And even as a female solo-traveler I never felt unsafe in this neighborhood. I'll definitely come back here.\n",
      "Great apartment in a great location. Less of the touristy feel of the Plaka. Walking distance to most things. Plenty of local restaurants and cheaper. \n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment (#2) had a great feel, was light and well equipped  and ideal for 2 people. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 'boys' were helpful and fun to talk to. Full of local advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended if you like to get away from the traditional hotel. \n",
      "Live in Athens #4 was awesome! We didn't arrive in Athens until around 11pm or so and they still had someone pick us up and greet us at the apartment when we arrived. The apartment was great, especially the bathroom and balcony. It's right in the heart of a very lively neighborhood with bars and restaurants. Plenty to do right outside the door. Definitely stay here if you're visiting Athens. \n",
      "This was my first experience staying at an Airbnb and we loved it. We were greeted by Cervillis (sp?) and his enthusiasm really got us excited for our first time in Athens. The Live in Athens #04 was 2nd floor simply decorated room that has a kitchen and bathroom off to the side across a small hallway that leads to the shared terrace with the rainbow spiral staircase. We really enjoyed the views of the murals on the surrounding buildings and the view of the cafes and restaurants and streets below. We had a really enjoyable experience and the Live in Athens team was very nice and helpful. Cervillis came by with a map and provided us a bunch of local spots to hit up and  explore. I liked the Greek yogurt that he gave us with his mom's special sour cherry topping. A healthy start to an amazing time in Athens. I wish we stayed longer. I would definitely recommend staying at one of the Live in Athens short-stay apartments. I would definitely check out a few of their other properties as well. Thanks Live in Athens team for making our first trip to Athens memorable and exciting. Can't wait to return! \n",
      "The stay at Live in Athens #04 was great. The rooms, terrace, and location on a small square in Monastiraki couldn't have been better. Everything was as pictured and the hosts did everything possible to make our stay great. I would definitely stay here again. \n",
      "#04 is a beautiful space that would be perfect for a group of friends or family coming to explore Athens.  Especially if one rented the downstairs unite as well. It was a bit too loud for us and I'm not a fan of the open bathroom (which is outside of the locked portion of the room), but it was otherwise perfect. Everything was clean and brilliantly decorated. \n",
      "#04 is a wonderful apartment located in Monastiraki, close the main monuments and attractions of Athens. It's a funny neighborhood, where you can find every thing you need: bars, restaurants, markets and pubblic transportations (the metro is very close). The apartment is fine decorated and clean. Live in Athens staff is simply superb: nice and hospitably. I can only raccomande. \n",
      "L'appartamento #04 é bellissimo, finemente arredato e situato in una deliziosa piazzetta a pochi passi da Monastiraki. Il quartiere é vivace e comodo in quanto  vicino alle principali attrazioni di Atene. Lo staff di Live in Athens é semplicemente perfetto: alla mano, gentili e super ospitali. Non posso che consigliare a tutti un soggiorno in uno dei loro appartamenti. \n",
      "We stayed in apt #3 and absolutely loved it. The boys made us feel so welcome and really tended to our every need arranging pick up at the airport, super early check in, plus suggested some great bars and restaurants.  The apartment has been really tastefully renovated right down to the finest detail.  Very convenient location (right near the airport train & heaps of great bars and cafes), plus the terrace is a great spot to sit and wind down with a cold beer to enjoy the lively square and take in the evening breeze.\n",
      "Honestly if you are going to Athens looking for excellent value accommodation in the heart of the action, look no further then the boys at live in Athens. They'll go out of their way to make sure you have a memorable stay. Thanks so much guys...\n",
      "The experience of living in Athens#3 was very good. The apartment was nice and clean and the host was there to welcome us and gave us good instructions to Athens, the neighbourhood and the apartment. Very friendly.\n",
      "The stay at Live in Athens #03 was great. The rooms, terrace, and location on a small square in Monastiraki couldn't have been better. Everything was as pictured and the hosts did everything possible to make our stay great. I would definitely stay here again. \n",
      "Very nice and comfortable apartment, really central, in a typical building of mid 20th century. 'Live in Athens' are really professionals and would definitely choose in the future, again, one of their properties. Only minor remark: if you stay at Live in Athens #3 and you mind about noise at night, do bring earplugs with you.\n",
      "We stayed in apartment #3 in Athens for 4 nights in July. The apartment is beautifully situated at Plateia Iroon with its charming cafes and bustling life day and night. The apartment is very pleasant to stay in with kitchen and a wonderful roof terrasse shared with the upstairs apartment. \n",
      "The staff at Live in Athens is extremely helpful and friendly. We will definitely consider staying with Live in Athens next time, too.\n",
      "Great location and friendly staff. From day one after booking with Live In Athens, we were impressed of the quality of their responsiveness and their help upon our arrival. The unit #3 is very well located in the Psyri district overlooking a lively little square. There is animation until 1am and live music. Great spot to visit with the family!\n",
      "Breathtaking is right. We will return to Greece and we will definitely stay here.  It is so easy to get to. From the airport take train #3 to Athens. At Syntagma station take train #2 one stop south to Acropoli station. When you exit to street level the apartment is in front of you. The Acropolis is on your left and the museum is on your right. In between are a dozen open air restaurants and tavernas and no cars. We landed at 4:30 and saw the sunset from Mars Rock overlooking the Agora. Panos met us when we arrived and marked up a map to show us everywhere to go. (North side of Athens is no-go territory) but we found a great music store there and my musician son bought a Balalaika. \n",
      "The apartment has great views and the roof is even better. We were quite comfortable with 5 adults. We were very active and walked all day. Three nights was the absolute minimum for this stay. I would recommend at least 4 or 5 nights to see Athens properly.  The 5 day metro pass for 10 euros each is a great deal and will get you everywhere except the airport. \n",
      "I could say more but my best advise is to see everything Panos circles on the map. We only met him when we first arrived but he was so thorough that we didn't need to reach him again. He is an amazing host.\n",
      "Anastas was fantastic! Very helpful and willing to show me around. This location is a little out of the way, but the #22 and #4 trams will get you downtown no problem. Room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. For light sleepers, earplugs may be needed as animals and other tenants of the building. I am a heavy sleeper, so I had no problem sleeping through it.\n",
      "Theodore and his family were ALL the wonderful things we had read about already, from the years of commentaries! Amazing how consistent he is!\n",
      "We especially enjoyed the terrace, even though it was starting to get colder at night.\n",
      "The proximity of the fresh produce/ groceries, close metro for the city, close tram (#5) for the beaches was awesome. We bought the 5 day transportation pass for 9 euros and were at the main sights in 10-15 min, saving our feet for all the discovering of ruins, the hiking of  the hills and the enjoying of the endless museums. The 30 euro museum pass helped us discover many places we would've passed up. We also took the tram afternoons to the beaches, (Voule was a peaceful favorite) and watching the sun set on the way home. Perfect location for our diverse interests. The ferry was not far either, by metro, easy to buy 8 euro tickets to island when you get to Pireus....\n",
      "Thanks for the great place/vacation, Theodore and family!\n",
      "Live in Athens #8 was a perfect stay. The location was right at the heart of everything. We were greeted with a traditional Greek treat and given some great tips to help city. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Terrace was especially lovely with a view of the lively streets below. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely recommend this to anyone staying I'm Athens so a day or week! \n",
      "We stayed in Live in Athens #5.  This is a newly renovated apartment as of May \n",
      "2014.  It is small, and in fact it is a room within the lobby area - the floor is tile, and there is no direct window to the outdoors (the \"window\" looks into the lobby area).  Nevertheless, it is very clean and the furnishings are all new.  Andreas and Vassilis are also very organized and knowledgeable of the area, and seem to know where the less touristy spots are in town.  The area around is also very interesting - you'll find hookah bars and hip eateries along your walk to Monastiraki Sq.  So all in all, this is a fine, tidy choice if you don't need a big space to crash in, or are not planning to spend lots of time in the apartment.  \n",
      "Our stay in Live in Athens #5 was great.  The room was very clean, the hosts very welcoming and helpful, suggesting places to eat and helping us orient ourselves with the city.  The location is amazingly convenient and the neighborhood has all kinds of bars, restaurants, and cafes.   We would definitely stay here again.  \n",
      "You can't go wrong staying at the #1 voted view in Athens.  Everything was perfect and as described.  The views alone is worth it all.  Walk to the Acropolis and many other sites.  Elevator takes you top floor with a small amount of stairs to reach top floor and an unforgetable experience.  Recommend having the taxi pre-arranged because of ease of getting to the home and the driver is wonderful.\n",
      "All great## katerina is wondrefull!!\n",
      "Nice apartment, equipped with all necessary for comfortable staying. Clean. Excellent location, close to Parliament and Downtown.\n",
      "I would strongly recommend it.\n",
      "Easy to get from airpot by publik transport (bus #95)\n",
      "Great value and service at Antoni's place!  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is next to the University and just down the block from the National Archaeological Museum.  There are good restaurants close by and the metro is a 7-minute walk.  Antoni's arranged for a taxi driver to pick us up at the airport after our long flight which was so very convenient.  We spent 5 nights/6 days in Athens and it was very hot. We had a great stay until perhaps the last day.  The air conditioning works fine in the living room but does not cool the back bedroom too well.  We slept on the couches the last night since we got back late and did not have time to cool off the bedroom.  On Friday nights there seems to be quite a lot of raucous going on in the streets with the music playing until 5AM and burning of dumpsters and garbage around the corner.  Also, the elevator broke the last day and it was a sweaty bummer to drag our heavy suitcases down 6 flights of stairs.  But the heat, Friday night noise and the elevator was not Antoni's fault.  He is a great host and I would still stay again.  Extras: We highly recommend Arcadia Restaurant (#26 on Tripadvisor) which is right around the corner.  We ate there twice.  We hired Alexis from Athens Taxi Wagon.  He was courteous, quite the character and spoke English perfectly.\n",
      "George and Markos are responsive, cool, and very welcoming. Staying at this flat allows you to really live like a local.  The flat is spacious, clean, urban, and has everything you need.  For a group of 4, there was more than enough space. \n",
      "\n",
      "The flat is in a perfect location - 2 -5 minutes to the metro, bars, grocery stores, bakery, cafe, and multiple tavernas.  They provide great recommendations and make checking in/out seamless.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Across my travels, I've come across decent hosts, good hosts, and great hosts. These guys are great hosts and I would not hesitate to stay here again. The reviews are consistently superb - and all true. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many thanks upon thanks Markos and George for making our time in Athens so comfortable! #superhosts2016 #warriors2016NBAchamps \n",
      "The Acropolis and major attractions are within waking distance, or take trolley #2, #11.  The place is close to the stadium.  Comfortable room and kitchen.  Great value.  \n",
      "Ari's was the most hospitable host we have ever encountered with Airbnb! He arranged transportation from the airport to the Airbnb location (additional charge, but very reasonable) and was there to greet us and give helpful tips on getting around the city and restaurants we should try. The place is centrally located to pretty much all of the great areas that a visitor wants to explore. Highly recommend. If we return to Athens I will absolutely check with Aris' place first as it would be our #1 option to stay.\n",
      "#The host: Theodore is a kind, responsive and caring host who offers a real cozy little apartment that's perfect for two people. We arrived a bit later than expected, but Theodore was waiting for us, having provided us with clear instructions how to get to the place and having offered a private transport from the airport (but we decided to explore on our own). He then contacted us often during our stay in order to make sure everything was OK. Also, we were lucky Theodore wasn't expecting anybody the check-out day but of course it was his hospitality that allowed us to leave our stuff the whole day and calmly prepare ourselves for a trip late in the evening. #The place: We found clean room and kitchen, comfortable beds, everything in terms of everyday amenities that one might eventually need and even croissants and some nice wine in the fridge to feel welcome and have a pleasant stay. #Accessibility: one could easily access some of the main squares in the center with a bus from the aprt. and continue with the metro or by walking. Or walk from the aprt. directly to the center. Also, the railway station is 10 min away by foot. #One advise for the host: a fan that's more quiet would be great, as being exposed to the sun, the place can't easily cool down in the night. #One advise for the guests: the map is your best friend in Athens! The place is near the center but if you prefer strolling, you might easily get confused in such a majestic city. :) \n",
      "George and Nasos were amazing hosts! They provided lots of great tips and were so helpful with our check in! Their place is in the perfect spot to see the sights, do some shopping, eat some great food and soak in the culture! The space was clean, stylish and we loved the balcony! We definitely recommend their place to those who want to #livelikelocal, we’ll definitely be back!\n",
      "L'apartament és molt acollidor, ben equipat i bastant cèntric, i la benvinguda i el tracte de l'amfitriona exquisits. Una opció molt recomenable per aquells que vagin a fer una estada de voluntariat al camp de refugiats d'Eleonas #RefugeesWellcome\n",
      "I’ve stayed at many airbnb’s and this has to be the #1 airbnb i have stayed at. not only is it beautiful, but it’s so clean and stylish. \n",

      "We were given specific and easy directions, and i’m so thankful for them. the location is a 10 min walk away from the center where the metro is located. it’s only a 5 min walk to the bus station that will take you to the airport. \n",
      "\n",
      "My sister and I definitely had an amazing stay. We felt so welcoming and warm.\n",
      "Iro's apartment is beautiful!  You get great light, and her decorative style is funky yet simplistic.  It's very close to the Acropolis and not far to walk to the main sights in Athens, yet the neighbourhood is not a touristy one and you get cheaper prices and a more authentic experience.  You're a two minute walk from Dio Dekares I Oka as well, currently #12 on restuarants in Athens -- a local dinner spot that I recommend visiting if you stay here!\n",
      "Johnny picked us up from the airport and dropped us off again very early in a Sunday morning.  Given that it was a 35 minute introductory view of Athens it was a reasonable fee and extremely appreciated. \n",
      "\n",
      "The secure flat is situated in a real, local neighbourhood which felt very warm, friendly and safe.  The bus stop to the centre, bus #r9 is 100 metres away (10 minute bus ride) outside of the restaurant recommended by Johnny where we ate enormous and delicious meals for 7-12 euros on the three nights we stayed here.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Johnny left tea, coffee, sugar, cold water, cookies, croissants, bathroom and cleaning products for us.  Supermarket very close too! The a/c worked, the balcony was nice, the beds were comfy.  There is a clothesline out from the rear balcony so I washed some clothes in the bathtub and they dried overnight, having found washing powder under the sink! \n",
      "\n",
      "Johnny was a charming host with brilliant English who did everything he could to make our stay in Athens memorable even offering ongoing assistance with our further travels.  We were able to see all the sights of Athens very easily by buyin a two day ticket for the hop on hop off sightseeing bus.  Do go to the Acropolois very early to beat the intense heat and the queue for tickets. Would stay again!\n",
      "Finally a CLEAN place! It was spotless!! #bless\n",
      "\n",
      "The place was super modern, and stylish. Our host, Manos, was incredible! He gave us recommendations for everything, and they all checked out. He checked in on us while we were staying there to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied. Amazing job! \n",
      "\n",
      "Great location, we could walk to everything we wanted to see. Absolutely a grea\n",
      "I've booked many AirBnB appartments during the last years, I've never got to know someone like Kostas. We can hardly put in words how much we loved the place and how much we appreciated everything Kostas did for us. The appartment is fantastic! Huge, spotless, great tastefull interior, two super big patios, very good and safe neighbourhood with nice bars and restaurants. Kostas went the extra mile in helping us, organizing our arrival, providing us with information at all times and was a truly generous host. We are very happy having the chance to stay with him for a second time and just want to say \"Thank you, Kostas!\" #besthostintheworld\n",
      "Nik's apartment is great! Super-easy to get to, since it's on the same metro line from the airport, and the airport bus also stops within five minutes' walk to the apartment. Very well-connected!\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment is a studio, so you're sleeping in the main room, but with the huge terrace the place doesn't feel small at all, it feels perfect for a couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The neighbourhood is also great - many great cafes and restaurants nearby, a couple of supermarkets, and an espresso cafe that's currently rated #1 for espresso in Athens.\n",
      "\n",
      "The streets aren't immaculate, some of the footpaths are in a bit of a state of disrepair, but this doesn't seem to be unique to Nik's neighbourhood, it's part of the charm of Athens overall, I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole a great place to stay in a well-connected area with plenty of places to eat and socialise right at your doorstep, and it's also very easy to get into the centre of town.\n",

      "Highly recommended.\n",
      "Fantastic little apartment overlooking a quiet neighbourhood with a beautiful view of the Acropolis in the distance. Comfortable bed, just perfect for a couple or solo traveller. Akis is a terrific host. Easy to communicate with. Very fast to answer all questions. The apartment is charming art deco style. Very compact. Great for preparing meals in fully equipped kitchen. And the #51 bus comes often and takes you to Omonia Square and metro in 10 minutes. All in all two thumbs up! We had a perfect stay. Thank you Akis.\n",
      "Fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have stayed in many Airbnbs around the world; Akis' place was one of my favorite. It was probably my #1 best Airbnb experience.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lovely flat, perfect for chilling and cooking and with a great work space as well.  Massive penthouse terrace, overlooking the Acropolis which is fantastically lit at night.  I quite enjoyed having a glass or two of Greek wine while pondering the history right before my eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful very local-style neighborhood with my laundry, haircut, tailor(!), pastry, camera store and anything else you want right at hand; there was a farmer's street market one block away one day where I purchased delicious vegetables and fruits like only Greece and Italy can do.  I walked to the center which is totally easy, but soon found that Uber is VERY available and so was ubering to the center and everywhere else for 3/4 euro per trip.  I had an 0600 flight out and so even took an uber there at 4am or so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Akis was a fantastic host and I'm embarrassed to say even helped me out when I locked myself out in the most friendly way.  He is a good fellow and I cannot recommend his flat highly enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short story: staying at Akis' flat in Athens was a fantastic experience and I very highly recommend it.  I extended my stay and would have more so if not for prior engagements.\n",
      "\n",
      "I almost forgot: the flat is like 700 meters from Plato's Akademia!  The very site!  Visiting those grounds was an amazing experience and is literally a five minute walk from the flat. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fantastic.\n",

      "We had a phenomenal time during our short stay in Athens and it is very much due to this apartment.  Location is hard to beat.  This was maybe 50 ft from the #1 rated restaurant in Athens per Tripadvisor (Cinque Wine and Deli Bar) and maybe 100 ft from #10 (and our personal favorite) restaurant Oineas.  It's 5 mins walk from the busy Monasteraki plaza but in a quiet residential area.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment looks exactly like the pictures.  It's the perfect oasis away from busy Athens without having to travel far.\n",
      "Fantastic local modern studio smack in the center of Psirri walking distance from Monastiraki Plaza Sontagma Square and the Acropolis. Hot water showers & comfortable bed, along with air conditioning. Tons of restaurants bars shopping and clubs near. Yet a quiet respite is #203. Also their driver reco was tops. Thanks Christos!\n",
      "# of night: 3. # of People: 3\n",
      "Overall: 5 stars\n",
      "This place was very spacious, clean and well-renovated. It's located in a very convenient place; about 5 minutes walk to Ancient Agora of Athens and Pl. Monastirakiou. There are many restaurants within 10 minutes walk. Our check-in went smooth. The host is very helpful and it was a great value for the price I paid.\n",
      "Alex's place was exactly as described -- in a great area and 2 metro stops from the Acropolis. Alex arranged a transfer to pick us up from the airport. The transfer was so great, we asked Alex if he could arrange the transfer back to the airport for us. Alex also gave us suggestions for dinner that evening. The apartment was great,  but 3 tips coming from Americans: #1- the elevator is a little scary, there is no button to open the door to get out, you just push it open. We didn't realize this and rode the elevator up and down a few times before we figured it out. Because of this, I always took the stairs leading me to #2- the stairs are not always lit, they must be on a timer. There are small, round,  white buttons on the wall- press those to turn the lights on.  #3- This is a Greece thing, you cannot flush toilet paper in all areas. Not a big deal, we were just confused at first but the more we went out, the more we noticed the same in other places. Very minor things and not at all reflective on the host, more just traveling tips. All in all everything was great! We loved Alex's place and especially the view, would love to go back!\n",
      "Vam passar només una nit just abans de la tornada a casa, tot va ser correcte i vam poder descansar còmodament. Els nostre vol va patir un retard i Giannis va ser molt comprensiu alhora de fer en check-in. Gràcies per tot.\n",
      "\n",
      "###\n",
      "\n",
      "We stayed the last night before our return to home, and all was correct and we could rest comfortably. Our flight suffered a delay and Gianni's prepared our check-in without problem. Thanks for all.\n",
      "Stratos is an amazing host! I've stayed with him multiple times and he is my #1 choice when staying in Athens! He's always available for anything you need and responds very quickly. The house is well maintained and clean. It's location is perfect for visiting Acropolis, you can see it from your balcony! Highly recommend him and any of his properties! Thanks Stratos :) \n",
      "Our hosts, Alex and Fernando, were very welcoming.  They are an awesome couple that went out of their way for us.  We arrived late but they both still took the time to show us what streets we should take, the bus stops and tell us about the neighborhood.  Right before our trip ended, we met up for drinks!\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment is comfortable.  Again, they took the time to add little things that make a difference.  What stood out the most was how clean they kept the apartment.  It was pretty spotless.  The kitchen was well equipped with everything we would need for our 6-night stay. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Floridians we don't do much walking, so my wife did find it a bit of a hike uphill to get back to the apartment in the afternoons.  We had been a bit intimidated by the bus system because there is no real information on their routes on their website or on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, so we didn't venture on them until the end of our stay.  I'd recommend learn it from day one.  Just hop on and see where it takes you, we did that on day 4 and was able to figure it out easily, or maybe it was easy because we had already walked most of Athens, that we knew exactly were we were at all times during the ride.  We recommend bus #11.  It takes you to the square, middle of Athens and in front of the archaeological museum (which we walked to and took us an hour). \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we were very happy with our stay.  We couldn't have asked for better hosts.  There are two or three restaurants right in front of the apartment and a few others just a block away - one that is open 24 hours.\n",
      "Stellina's place was wonderful! It was clean and had everything we needed. The location isn't in the center of Athens, but the bus stop is right outside and the bus #12 takes you to the center in no time. A 5 day bus pass costs $9 and you can use it for all public transport (metro included). Stellina's bed is comfortable, coffee was great, and she even left us some food. She answered all of our questions and both her and her mother were very kind. Definitely recommend this home! \n",
      "#nice\n",
      "Maria’s little gem is highly recommended! She is a thoughtful host  offering us a local Greek hosting experience in the heart of Athens! The apartment is minimal, clean and in one of the liveliest neighborhoods. #loveIt\n",
      "Thank you dear Maria. Hospitality was #1 . My Fav part of the stay was the chalkboard with the personal notes and the tvroom area. the washroom needs renovation to match the rest of this nice apartment. \n",
      "Perfect Airbnb for the 3 of us. It was easy to get to from the airport by metro bus #X95. Location is great for sights, shopping & restaurants in the heart of Plaka /Syntagma square.\n",
      "Communication with entire Airbnb staff was very prompt. They went above & beyond like setting up a taxi to Piraeus at 5 am.\n",
      "I definitely recommend this sweet Airbnb unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you Georgina,  Alexandra, Aries & Gregory for everything.\n",
      "Location, location, location! Yiorgos' place is a hop-skip to the #1 attraction in Athens. It's a comfortable place - bed was comfortable, everything worked and no complaints! Check-in was great- he spent over 30 minutes to tell me where to go, what to do, how to get there and etc! I booked this last minute so I appreciated the info. as I did no planning! Thank you for a great stay- and thank for taking the time to help this tourist!\n",
      "The accommodation was in a great location, it's just steps away from the Olympic Stadium, and we walked to the other places too. There is a bus stop very close by and you can take the trains from Olympic Stadium. The place is very comfortable and Mowglie, the dog, is very friendly. If you are taking the ferry to an island, please go a bit earlier, because traffic at the ports is bad, it took us 45 mins to get to our port #3 by taxi.\n",
      "My family of five stayed for four nights and loved every minute. The apartment was perfect and Marika was easily contactable with very helpful with local advice. The whole apartment was so well set up for visitors from the full kitchen (where coffee and biscuits and the owner's own honey were left for us), living room, balcony etc, to the little helpful things like shampoo and pegs. It was all lovely. The location was great. Bus stops close by, walking distance to several museums and parks, and great restaurants. The restaurant at #6 with the pita wraps is fantastic. There's a convenient small supermarket just on the corner, or a big (cheap) proper supermarket 2 blocks easy walk away. Oh, and the airconditioning!  We ended up sightseeing early and coming home each day for pita wraps in the airconditioning for a rest before heading out again in the afternoon. We were so close to the city that two trips a day was no drama. Great apartment and hosts. Thanks!\n",
      "    In general the apartment was pretty clean and Marika was a great hostess. The only problem was the appearance of a cockroach during night #2. Maybe that was a single incident but I engaged in cockroach hunting in the middle of the night. I don't know if was so unlucky, but also the TV didn't work at all. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe but just above the apartment there is a tavern-restaurant and until 3 after midnight, tables and chairs were moving with noise all the time. The only way not to bother you is to be very-very tired. In the bottom line I can say that I might stay again but only if the are some upgrades to the apartment. \n",
      "All previous reviews have summed up accurately the pluses and minuses for Konstantino's place.  Theh #1 reason to book this apartment is for the incredible view of the Acropolis.  #2 is the location.  5 minutes from Metro station plus easy walk to all parts of Athens.  The minuses are all inside.  1. Mattress on floor.  Small kitchen and tiny bathroom.  But all of this can be seen in the photos so if you book here then know what you are getting.  The apartment could use a fresh coat of paint and some updating.  \n",
      "I cannot say enough wonderful things about our host Eleni!  She was a fabulous host!  Our start to my and my two teenagers first vacation to Greece ( first to Europe / we are  From Canada - it is our “trip of a lifetime - 4 countries in 3 wks ) was not smooth as we missed our flight from Spain which then complicated our travel connections to Paros island.  Eleni had initially arranged our taxi to pick us up at Athens airport and when we didn’t arrive on the initial flight - she communicated immediately to us and then proceed to help us reschedule our ferry to the island for  the next , she picked us up at the bus station ( she sent me exact directions and bus #’s to take to arrive closest to her apartment - made it so easy for us after long journey by planes)  and she made taxi arrangements for us he next morning  to the port of Piraeus to catch the ferry.  What started as a rough start to our Greece vacation  went smoothly because of Eleni’s help and kindness !  Her apartment was only a couple minutes from Syntagma square - it was the perfect size - and Nicely decorated, so clean and beds comfy. It was nice to have cold water and juice in the frig and small snacks and coffee and tea left for is when we woke up.  She gave us ideas of where to get some breakfast, pasties  and coffee right across the street from her place. She was so friendly and kind to my children and I.   Our week in Paros is coming to an end and we are once again staying at Eleni’s apartment the night before we catch our next plane to Paris.  We know we are in good hands with Eleni as our host!  I would highly recommend her place to stay !   \n",
      "Marina’s apartment is a short walk from the slopes of the Acropolis and Filoppapou hill, hence well located. The #15 trolley bus which stops right outside the apartment takes you straight to the National Archaeological Museum. There are many restaurants within reasonable walking distance from the apartment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Marina is a very responsive host and we had a great time in her apartment and Athens.\n",
      "UNBELIEVABLE VILLA MELITI.\n",
      "Located in the trendy inner suburb of Kerimeikos on a leafy quite street amongst endless local cafes, bars and restaurants you get a true Athens taste. We were promptly contacted by Aristea and greeted at the villa itself by greek goddess Nandia who gave us a tour of the stunning villa and helpful local tips and recommendations to maximize our stay. Made up of 4 newly renovated bedrooms and massive living spaces, courtyards, kitchen (all brand new), dinning, lounges (7tvs in total) and the centre piece... indoor jet pool inside the living room!!! We never wanted to leave the villa although just 15min walk away is the Acropolis and down town area. Ideal for a group of friends or older families (stairs and pool not ideal for young kids). I'm already looking for an excuse to come back and visit Villa Meliti... #VillaIsBetterThanPhotos\n",
      "Perfect hosts! \n",
      "We loved the space and deck was great! Condo is 2 blocks from bus stop where you can get on #40 and within 4 -5 stops you're at main square-Stygma (parliament)...then walk everywhere! Had breakfast on deck every morning. Also, 3 great restaurants (all adjacent to each other) near bus stop; Italian, Greek, and combo. Handy 24 hr mkt 1 block away.\n",
      "Beautiful place in walking distance from the city's center Acropoli, quite neighborhood with everything you may need as pharmacy, markets or even the traditional bakery in the corner. The host provides informations who may can help you with your journey, the apartment also was clean and nice with all facilities.\n",
      "   ##RECOMMENDED##\n",
      "Dimitris place is fantastic. Located on a hill overlooking Athens, it is spacious with great amenities. The pictures are quite accurate and the pool is fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taxi travel in Athens is very cheap and needed. Most trips are 4.6 - 6 euros. I used an ap called taxi beat which Dimitris’s assistant recommended. It’s a great ap as you can text for an a taxi and it arrives in 3-10 minutes. It’s a better version of Uber with more information about the position of the taxi, the taxi plate # and driver information. \n",
      "\n",
      "The food in Athens is surprisingly excellent. It’s comparable to Italy in freshness and quality. Be warned however, the portions are huge... There were 4 of us and we over ordered for the first 2 days. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summation I will definitely stay with Dimitris when we visit Athens again.\n",
      "This place is so cool!  #1 the view is amazing, you can easily see the Parthenon right from the back balcony. The style of the place was very modern with a very urban feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "The shower room (yes it’s a whole room) was very unique and well designed.\n",
      "Downtown Athens during the dead of summer at the time of the Panagias holiday ( the dormition or assumption of the Virgin Mary holiday on August 15th ) was simply dreamy. The flat sat loftly, high up and nestled amongst a throng of apartment buildings with balconies laden with flowers and plants and the looming, massive and elegant President hotel making the feel of my view from any of the penthouse balconies ( duplex thus an upstairs and downstairs) somewhat surrealistic.  And was it quiet! with most residents having return to their hometowns for the summer event, Athens had the feel of an almost apocalyptic day after.  ( oh Neutron bomb where have you gone?) \n",
      "\n",
      "I know, I am being #dramatic \n",
      "\n",
      "The flat was modern with the light pouring in all day as the sun swept across the southern sphere.  My hosts Michalis and Irene were wonderful and assured everything we needed was there or somewhat close to us in the very residential neighborhood of Ambelokipi.  It is the perfect location for touring the historic and classical Athens.  Thank you both.\n",
      "This is my first time to try Airbnb and get satisfied with it!\n",
      "Τόνια is a really nice and welcoming host. She even showed me how to get the metro to Acropolis and also the way to the airport!!!! \n",
      "The house was so amazing including the decorations which were designed by her. The room that I stayed was also wonderful, clean and had great atmosphere.  Bus stop was just beside of the house and the metro was 10 mins by walk.\n",
      "The last but not the least, I loved the breakfast she made for me! #recommend\n",
      "The hosts are amazingly nice, punctual and generous. They provided us, upon arrival a few, but necessary articles: (they were not obligated to do so but they did and it was very thoughtful) eggs, bottles of water, butter, cheese, bread, coffee..They also provided shampoo, detergent. The condo is clean, modern, beautiful. It has 3 A/C (one per room), and most importantly, a washing machine. We really felt at home.\n",
      "It is closed to the metro and tram ( 2 short streets away). You are at 2 or 3 metro stations from Acropolis, Plaka, Monastiraki, Syntagma Square... you can take the tram #5, it will bring you straight to the beach and shopping areas. You can buy for 9€/person, an illimited public transit ticket for 5 days.\n",
      "It will cost you around 50€ by taxi from the airport to the condo, but if you use Uber, only 30€. \n",
      "Although the description of the apartment is very precise, including a floor pant (blue print), and the apartment had everything one might need, there are a few points that preclude me from saying it is truly excellent.\n",
      "1) The building per se is very run down, and when I walked into it the first thing I though was \"what have I chosen...\"  However, as I said, the apartment per se is quite good, and if you are able to forget about the downstairs area, you will be fine.   And before I forget, the balcony view is really great, but with the ongoing constructions upstairs (see below) we did not use the balcony much, except for taking a few photographs.\n",
      "2) The floor plant is a bit weird, with the kitchen located between the bedroom and the bathroom in both apartments.  We rented  apartments #1 and #2, and one of them is actually a single long room \"dived\" by an armoire.  If you need/want privacy to shower/using the bathroom it may not be the place for you. Again, the floor plan is provide as one of the pictures, so just look at it.\n",
      "3) I have an issue with places that don't offer proper storage for ones clothes.  The \"wardrobe\" was actually a metallic rod with a fabric cover, this in both rooms.  I did not use it, but as I said, I am very particular about where I place my clothes.\n",
      "4) We were not warned that there was construction going on elsewhere in the build.  After our long flight from the US, we were awaken at 7 AM by construction noise that felt as if someone was scraping the ceiling above our heads.  I send a message to Dimitris (after getting up and having some coffee, as I was quite tired and jet legged) who immediately solved the issue.  However, this should not have happened at the first place, and we should been warned  about the ongoing remodeling on the upstairs apartment.  They worked until  9-10 PM sometimes, and I did not complain to Dimitris again, as the longest was on the night we were packing to leave.  The noise stopped around 10 PM,  just when we were getting ready to go to bed\n",
      "5) while in there, I read the previous reviews with more attention, and they mention noisy wood floors.  Just want to clarify that the floor has been remodeled and is concrete (or something similar), very new and clean, and certainly not noisy.\n",
      "It is easy to see that Dimitris pays attention to these reviews, and works hard to maintain, update and improve his place. He really is a quick responder. The check-in and check-out are also no fuss, but missed some of the personal touches we encountered in other places, where we were received with flowers, fruits, champagne, port wine, etc. and we actually meet someone face-to-face.  All that said, very easy to get in and out, as you do not depend on anyone's schedule.\n",
      "BEST IN ATHENS!\n",
      "Vassilios’ place is exceptional! So many good things can be said about the host, and the apartment.\n",
      "The view is spectacular! The location is #1.\n",
      "Vassilio’s is warm and welcoming, and went out of his way to make sure we were settled in.\n",
      "The kitchen came with fresh fruit and bread with a selection of jams. Teas & coffee. Bottle water.\n",
      "Vassilio’s gave us maps of the surrounding neighbourhood and directions to the best Kebab pitas we’ve had on our entir trip. \n",

      "Book here - you will not regret it! \n",
      "In late June, I stayed in apartment # 4 and my friends were downstairs in apartment # 3. Dimitri was easy to communicate with - he organised us an airport transfer and even picked up a parcel for me (thanks Dimitri!). \n",
      "\n",
      "The neighbourhood has some unsafe areas, but I felt very safe during the stay at the apartment. The local area may not look like much during the day, but in the evening it comes to life with open bars, live music and ambience. It's an easy walking distance to Psyrri and Monastiraki and the Acropolis etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "The view from the apartment rooftop is spectacular! \n",
      "Just book it. I’ve stayed in 6 different Airbnb’s in the past 4 weeks, and this has been my #1 favorite! Outstanding customer service,  fluent and Frequent communication, VERY clean and beautiful apartment - Kostas is amazing! He even let me change check in time earlier than scheduled at the last minute and gave me great tips on his favorite places to eat and visit. The Apartment is equipped with all linens, soap, toiletries, and kitchen amenities, to make you feel right at home!! I wish I could have stayed longer, because him and Joanna (his assistant) are one of kindest and most helpful persons I’ve met throughout europe. In terms of location, SUPERB - it’s right next to restaurants, bars, shopping and of course - walking distance the Acropolis!!! Thank you Kostas!!\n",

      "The area:\n",
      "A treasure, near Acropolis where you can combine both sightseeing and night out! I realized that this specific area is the #1 choice for young athenians to live in. Met few locals and had chance to learn more insights for them. I highly recommend Bel Ray Bar (try the croque monsier plate), half minute walk from the apt. Not forgot to mention that the apt. is located at a quiet corner though. \n",

      "There to assist anytime, polite and very helpful. Definately looking forward to met you in my next trip to Athens!\n",
      "We stayed for 3 nights with a group of 9 guests at George's place. The place is divided in 3 different appartments with a different style of interior. The accommodations are well equiped and the rooftop terrace is just divine. My friends and I had a lovely stay in Athens! Also the communication between me, George and his sister Efi was great. Everything went really smooth! #superhost Thanks for everything ! Cheers Jérémy\n",
      "My family and I ended our European vacation in Athens and fell in love with the beautiful city! Our host met us at the apartment which is in a perfect location and all the big sites are easily accessible by foot. Vasiliki had a lovely chocolate cake and bottle of wine waiting for my family after a travel day! This was the perfect touch. The apartment is the perfect size and has many treasures that give it that homey vibe. The view is AMAZING! Not only do you have a top notch view of the Acropolis BUT you also have a perfect view of the #1 outdoor cinema in the world! Perfect to lay in bed a watch the new movies out! This place was amazing and could not have been more perfect! We look forward to our return to Greece and all of the lovely people! \n",
      "#Excellent Hosts who are really available to respond to any query (however silly)\n",
      "# Location-wise quite safe \n",
      "# Enjoyed that there was a Cleaning service attached to the apartment.\n",
      "# All amenities in working condition and clean\n",
      "# Water available at all times\n",
      "This is a great quiet location. A short walk to nearest metro station Petrolona & even closer on the #15 bus route. We loved the easy access key safe as we arrived late. Washing machine was also very handy. George was very prompt with his responses.\n",
      "Spiro's has a lovely apartment, it was clean and the air conditioner kept it cool. We walked everywhere we needed to go,  but the #4 bus is available right on the front Street and taxis are always available if you need one. There are lots of bars and eateries close by, and if you want to cook, the grocery/market is also close.\n",
      "This is a great apartment in the Kolinaki area. There are at least 4 supermarkets & 3 deli type gourmet stores in the immediate area. 6 blocks from Holmes Place, a top rate gym. There you can find a large indoor pool, sauna, steam, weights and many top line machines. Very nice short walk to Syntagma Square & the Kolinaki park is even closer. The Electric Tram # 5 will take you to at least 5 different beaches all very nice for a day at the beach. The best part is that you can always return to a comfortable apartment. There are just so many things I could write about that are close. The main points are the the bed is comfortable and the bathroom has sufficient light and great water pressure. This is a class apartment.\n",
      "Excellent location close to city center & Acropolis on a quiet residential street.  We had an issue with check-in when we were waiting at the door for 20 mins.  Turns out that the host was already inside waiting for us but we didn't have the buzzer # to ring that unit.  Would've helped if we had be provided with the unit # in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apt was roomy and pretty clean.  It was well stocked and had everything we need.  Hosts were responsive and available to help when we had issues with the Greek washing machine.  The machine itself was a little moldy but serviceable.  \n",
      "Tasos's  apartment is well located. You are in the Plaka on a street primarily for pedestrians, but it is not one of the main streets so you avoid the bustle.\n",
      "The layout is great for a family with a teenager.  To the right of the entrance is a hallway off of which are the bathroom, kitchen, and bedroom with double bed and desk. To the left of the entrance is another bedroom with two twin beds and straight in from the entrance is a family room which also can be entered from the bedroom.  The kitchen is functional with a small table for two.\n",
      "The apartment has 3 main drawbacks. #1 -- Like the rest of Greece, you are not supposed to flush toilet paper down the toilet so cleaning your bum with the shower next to the toilet takes getting used to if you come from a place where this is not the norm. #2 -- The ceiling of the bathroom is low and the only wall mount for the shower-head is at waist level. At 6' 4\" I found the shower troublesome though not impossible to use. #3 -- Street noise in the bedroom with the twin beds. The street is generally quiet, but when people pass you can hear every word of their conversation. Ear plugs are suggested if you are a light sleeper.\n",
      "It was a nice place to stay. It was more than I expected since it was my first time using airbnb. It has a washer and dryer which is helpful for us.  The wifi was out of service during rain storm but it was backed up the next day. We had trouble finding the place the first time. We used map.me app to take us there since we had no cellular signal.  Mr. Sorotis was available as needed when I texted him. He was there to greet us at the corner of the street at 10pm which is very helpful since we took train and wasn't familiar with the area. It was a short walk to the station.  There is a station #84 near the train station to take us directly to the cruise port. We are traveling with 3 little kids and a grand mom. \n",
      "Great studio for a couple, ideally located in the center of Athens, great to go visit Athens' Acropolis, the Flea market and so on. A ton a nice restaurants near by ! \n",

      "Our stay at Tony's apartment was very enjoyable. The apartment was clean and decorated in the most modern of decor, making the vibe most luxurious. The location was also most convenient as there were a plethora of bars and restaurants in the surrounding area. It was also relatively close to the ancient monuments, again a plus. Overall we would definitely use this apartment again if we were to come back to Athens again. #IssaVibe\n",
      "My friends and I stayed here for 1 night before our flight home. The space is amazing. # bedrooms with 2 queen beds and 1 single bed, very roomy. The balcony is massive. The apartment is in walking distance to bars and clubs, if you're gay travelers, this is REALLY close to the 2 popular gay clubs. Toni was quick at responding as well....I highly recommend it.\n",
      "LOCATION: I arrived at the airport, took the blue #3 line to Monstraki, then changed to the green line to Kifissia getting off one stop later at Victoria station (10 euro). The apartment is only ½ block from the Victoria Station. It is an ideal location to get around anywhere in the city, and only ½ block from numerous markets to shop for food. APARTMENT: The apartment is exactly as described: Lovely, extremely clean, well-stocked, good wi-fi, working air conditioning, hot water readily available, quiet 2nd floor location with elevator access, and a very nice balcony fronting the main street. HOST: Kleo is absolutely charming! My arrival was delayed due to a train problem, but Kleo and her husband were there to greet me. I had a problem one day with the internet, and they quickly and efficiently reset to it to work again. They checked to make sure all was well, without being overly intrusive. OVERALL:  I travel to Athens about twice per year. This is the place I will definitely stay in the years ahead if it is available. Wonderful host; wonderful apartment; and a wonderful location!\n",
      "This place is perfect!! I wish I had been able to stay longer. The rooftop view and hangout space is so charming, and the studio is incredible! Everything you need, including snacks and coffee :) Angelos was so kind and responsive, and his #1 dinner recommendation was delicious. Plus it is super close to the Acropolis metro station, which gives great access to the whole city. I will definitely return and stay here again!\n",
      "If your (Hidden by Airbnb) map and GPS can find #18, STAY HERE!   Grafitti is political wall-art in important Athens cafe and bookstore neighborhood. Gorme Bakery is two doors away on the corner--try the Apple Cake! Ice cream shop is one block away, open till 02:00 (2am)!\n",

      "Appartement très bien placé dans le centre d’Athènes à proximité de toutes commodités, instructions très claires à notre arrivée. Bon séjour en général dans la chambre #23\n",
      "Anna's place is cute, clean, and quiet inside. Room #23 in which my mom and I stayed was newly remodeled and has cute modern touches. Her instructions are clear and comprehensive. She includes pictures and a lot of detail to help you. She is also very responsive, and answered all of my questions quickly. If you need directions or recommendations she is available. Her place is a 5 minute walk to the city center and the Monastriaki Metro stop from the airport. There are many restaurants and markets very close by. I highly recommend her place and you'll love your stay in Athens.\n",
      "Another fantastic mstay at this apartment! This is our second stay in the apartment, this time in room #23. It was great, a super spacious room, really comfortable with a great shower, TV, space to hang clothes, etc. Spotlessly clean and in a great area. Feels almost hotel like. Excellent communication from the hosts and great local tips. The only thing to note is that at present there are road works so there is only a very narrow pavement to get to the building. This could be difficult for people with large luggage or with mobility issues. Wasn’t a problem for us. Thanks for a great stay! \n",

      "Tamara’s place is very close to the #2 red line metro, and also near most of the main points of interest. Everything is within walking distance, I didn’t need to take any transportation during my stay here at Tamara’s house. There are many restaurants near the metro station, there are also lots of cafeteria, bakery and grocery stores around the neighborhood. Tamara is very kind and respects your own space. If you need help, Tamara is more than welcome to give you a lots of great tips/info about Athens. I enjoyed my stay at Tamara’s place.\n",

Lovely veranda for morning coffees, our two years old played outdoor a lot, clean and quiet, only Greek neighbours in the area. An appartement located few minutes walking from the tram #4,5 which will zoom you right to the beach in no time. Several superb supermarkets in the vicinity, (Galaxy, Sklavenitis, Lidl). A large park ideal for a morning jog or street workout, has kids playground. Few authentic Greek cafes just round the corner. All the functional necessities in the apartment,  home away from home .\n",
      "We had the most wonderful stay at Eirini's place. She was very quick on response and went out of her way to make our honeymoon visit one to remember. The location is in a very hip part of Athens, walking distance from good restaurants and most of the local must-see sights. The apartment was so stunning inside (#homegoals) with everything you need to make your stay very comfortable (good wifi, aircon...) We even got some ideas for decoration for our own place at home from the apartment. I would suggest making this your base for a 1 week (or more) tour of Athens. Sad to leave!!\n",

There even was a tiny balcony.\n",

      "Check-in was very easy which made use of a lockbox. Evangelia responded quickly so we didn't have any trouble getting in. Reaching the Apartment is very convenient because it only takes around 10 minutes to walk to the metro (M3 Line) which goes straight to the airport. Reaching the parthenon is really easy too with this metro line.\n",

      "The best thing about this apartment has to be hands-down its amazing location which is near many AMAZING highly rated restaurants in trip advisor. Some of which are walkable (5F which is #4 of 2,160, Oroscopo at # 44, Katsourbos #143, Varka @ # 191). Around the corner is: Facce Strane, despite being at # (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) has some of the best pizza we had ever tasted. You’ll also find a starbucks and a mini grocery OK market within walking distance from the apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This apartment is a hidden gem and if you enjoy good food it'd be a shame not to stay at Evangelia’s place!\n",
      "The place was centrally located in Syntagma square, and apartment was decent. However, the photos on the listing and the actual rooms varied a lot, and when I asked the host, he made excuse that renovation was done and he did not have time to update photos. #False. Its unfortunate that despite the house being nice, it was disappointment to not have 100% accuracy in the listing. Otherwise the house was ok to stay\n",
      "Lovely apartment, with parking (HUGE BONUS), an elevator, quiet building, easy to find & a good location.  Very quick to reply (even helped us get delivery b/c we didn't have a Grecian phone # we were unable to order but they let us use theirs!!), self check in was super easy & convenient.  Toiletry baggies with all the essentials including slippers were on the beds & a bottle of wine on the table.  A wonderful welcome gesture. Definitely recommend.\n",

      "For central accommodation this  location is second to none.  It strolling distance to all the historical attractions and a wide choice of local restaurants and bars. It is close to various forms of transpor, you will not need a car.  On hot days I recommend taking the #5 tram to Voula beach where you get a banana lounge and umbrella.  In the evenings if you are in the mood for buzzing atmosphere just make a left at the apartment gates to the street bazaars and you will be mixing with the throngs of tourists and locals who are gift and souvenir hunting. \n",

      "Absolutely Amazing!  Our recent trip to Athens was a surprise trip for my wife, but a way for my wife and I to take advantage of some must needed quality time (We have 3 kids...lol).  Emmanuela is a jewel of a host and the suites in building 5 are nothing more than incredible.  We spent a week and a half between Athens and Santorini (mainly in Athens) and we couldn't have pick a better place to enjoy our time there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#5 (let's refer to the building as such)... is a carefully designed building with modern touches throughout.  It boasts beautiful colored themes (1st floor suite BLUE), (2nd floor suite YELLOW), and the maisonette (the crown jewel) up top is everything you would image it to be.  From views of the Acropolis to the most amazing sunsets, the maisonette was my absolute favorite...ABSOLUTE!  Every suite in #5 was well equipped to handle all of our needs.  From the shower dispensers (Body Wash, Shampoo, and Conditioner) to the universal outlet adaptors.  Each suite had a BOSE bluetooth speaker, which nailed it for me; because I need music to fill my environments.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Emmanuela stayed in touch with us before, during, and also when it was time to check out.  I believe everyday, she sent a message to check to make sure everything was in order.  It is without doubt that she prides herself behind providing the best experience with your stay at #5.  She even went over and beyond, by helping me plan an amazing night on our anniversary with suggestions for dinner and even making the reservation to insure we had the best table there...and we did.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Any suite you choose in #5 will be well worth it.  We were walking distance to everything.  The building faces/connects to Ermou St, for your shopping needs, which is the same direction as the Ancient Agora, which connects you to just about everything you would want to see and visit in Athens.  The neighborhood has late night bars and restaurants, so there is no chance of you being hungry if you were out late roaming the city.  The building itself is very secured with alarm devices in each unit as well as front door cameras.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing about this place went unnoticed in the design of this building.  Even the outdoor garden area, which was actually receiving a makeover because Emmanuela and her team felt it was not up to par.  Now, you can get the best photos there (lighting there was perfect).  I am more than certain, when we return to Athens, if by then Emmanuela hasn't added other places to her portfolio, we will be staying at #5...no doubt.  You should not waste time with booking any suite at #5...don't miss out, it is truly worth it.  PEACE.\n",
      "my top 3 of my stay in the place of Stefan and Kleia. #1. The patio. in the morning perfect place to do some laptop work. #2. Location. Close to the metro makes it easy to reach. Really nice is the neighborhood. The house is next to a small square. At night you have the feeling the whole neighborhood is gathering their (and no other tourist :) #3. The self check-in is still personal by the contact via the app.\n",
      "It was very nice stay. I regret I had just one night in Athens. Maria arranged check-in even if she was physically unavailable at that time. Apartment looks much better than on pics, is very spacious and very convenient. Maria's brother is very nice and helpful. There are some touristic guides in the shared area - useful if you are in Athens for the first time. I'd like to notice that bus #230 is going to the centre and to touristic places. Could stay there once again next time!\n",
      "I would definitely rent this place again.  The apartment was beautiful and in a great location.  We were able to walk to all the major stuff we wanted to see.  The hostess provides a book that points out a lot of local stuff and, when we needed a local mobile # to order takeout, they responded to our texts very promptly and helped us.  It was a nice touch!\n",
      "The place is great! Very spacious. Humongous bathroom. And very nice layout for 2 people. The location could not be better. Right near some of the best bars (#6 cocktail bar in the world, The Clumsies, and the #30, Baba au Rum) and restaurant that Athens has to offer. It is also near shopping (Plaka) and tourist sites, such as the Acropolis. Really close to the train station, as well. Although the apartment itself is nice, the best part of this place is easily the location. I would highly recommend this to a younger crowd trying to explore as much of the city life/night life as possible. \n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights. It was better than we could have ever imagined. Sakis & McGyver were exceptional hosts & took great care of us. Anything we needed they accommodated to and were fun to talk to. We spent our first night having dinner with them at one of their choice restaurants. The bonus was their  rooftop view  looking straight at the Acropolis. We drank wine with Acropolis every evening and loved the views both ways overlooking the city. The apartment is small but has everything you need. Spotlessly clean & maid service if desired. Great location to any of the sights & connecting neighborhoods. If we came back to Athens this is #1 on our list. Definitely a must! Thank you Sakis & McGyver for such a memorable stay.\n",
      "Athens' Bliss #1 is a modern, sleek, super clean, and spacious apartment situated in a quiet courtyard in Athens historic district overlooking an old church about a few hundred meters from Syntagma square, but also fairly close to the old town Plaka.  It has just about everything we need, truly a home away from home for a family of 4 or 5.  Supermarket, restaurants, shops are just outside, even a telecom shop (Cosmote) where we got our local sim card because we didn't have time to get it at the airport.  Chryssa from the travel agency located 1 floor above the apartment was a wonderful host, she helped book transportation from and back to the airport for us.  The apartment looks exactly like in the pictures, fully equipped for home cooking for a break from the delicious Greek cuisine.  The best thing is, and it may sound funny, that it came with more than enough toilet paper and trash bags for a full week stay!  We will definitely stay here again or at Athens Bliss #2, right next door!   Thank you Philippe and Chryssa.  You have a top rated apartment and a top rate management team!  \n",
      "Appartment is clean cosy spacious and comfortable. Location is perfect. Near monastiraki metro in psiri area where there are plenty of cafes restaurants and nightlife. Its a bit noisy at night but its ok for a couple of nights for young people. Even i didn't meet Marina in person she explained everything before check in and she was super kind. My #1 choice for future visits. Recommended.\n",
      "Very clean \"Ikea style\" brand new apartment. Good value. Very central, close to everything, shops, nice restaurants... Perfect to visit Athens by foot. No view on this one so the flat #1 and #2 from the same owner (same adress, same floor but opposite side) might be a better option depending on the price and availability !\n",
      "We have stayed in many AirBnBs worldwide and Sotiris's is THE best we have ever stayed in. The location is perfect, near the Acropolis, walking distance to the major sites. The place was SPOTLESSLY clean, comfortable, warm, and thoughtfully put together. Sotiris will even meet you at the Metro to make check-in a breeze. Special touches included olives and oranges from their land, and an appreciated beverage or two in the fridge. We also really enjoyed the local neighbourhood. We experienced everything from winning a pub quiz across the street with new friends, to friendly fine dining at the #23rd best restaurant in Athens, two doors down the street. Couldn't recommend higher.\n",
      "I reluctantly rented this apartment because I had a terrible cold and thus did not want to stay at a cousin's house. However,I'm so glad I did ... It was a pleasure to stay in a very cute and convenient apartment on an old Fashioned Athenian street with plenty of local color. (the old trolley tracks are still embedded on Herakleidon St.!)It is within a comfortable walking distance of everything we needed. Supermarket, bakery, restaurants, metro stop Thesion, tourist sites were all handy. And then of course, the ancient ruins/museums were also close, a 30 minute walk to the wonderful Acropolis Museum. We also discovered a little gem of a museum on  the street  itself at #16. (Don't miss it, the time we went it had an exhibit of archaic Greek technology which contained a replica of an ancient robot called an automaton-it was a wooden woman who was programmed to pour you a glass of wine.Pretty good for centuries B.C. eh?)\n",
      "\n",
      "     Panayiotis was a wonderful host. He had the basics, coffee, and tea, crackers plus some refreshments in the fridge waiting for us. The apartment has 2 ample size bedrooms with 2  balconies. Panayiotis told me when there are no leaves on the trees ,in the winter you can see the Acropolis from the balcony. However,  just walk up to the roof and get a first class view, there are places to sit up there too and enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The apartment sleeps 4 people on beds and also has a sleeper sofa. Since it was only the 2 of us , really at first I thought that it was terribly silly to rent this place for just 2 people. However, the location and the amenities made it more than a good price.  I found the kitchen very easy to work in for a simple meal and everything was spotlessly clean. The internet worked great.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Panayiotis knows everyone and everything, he can give you good suggestions of where to go. His parents live upstairs so it was comforting for me to know that he was only a few steps away. This is the first time I have not stayed with relatives in Athens. Staying at Panayiotis' place made me realize that it is such a good idea  to stay here when you don't want to bother relatives and still have easy access to places that Athens has to offer.\n",
      "Exchanging messages with Maria before I booked, I knew I was in good hands.  I immediately overcame my worry about being the first guest of this new Airbnb property.  Maria responded quickly to any question I had in flawless English and always went above and beyond to help me out.  Maria and husband, David, are exactly what you'd want in Airbnb hosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I much more prefer staying in local neighborhoods over tourist districts.  The apartment is located off a commercial street full of local shops, bakeries, patisseries and even 2 nearby Sklaventis (large supermarket chains).  A parallel street 2 blocks away has bars, restaurants, Lidl, shisha cafe and a large number of gyro joints (\"Mandraki Tavern\" was my favorite).  In the opposite direction a few blocks away, Maria's suggestion, a new branch of \"Babadan\" turned out to be the absolute best souvlaki/kalamaki I had in my 3 week stay in Athens!  In other words, it was a great neighborhood with friendly locals.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get in and out of city center, easily grab the #2 or #11 buses from/to Syntagma (in front of Nike store).  For those that enjoy walking,  it's an easy 25 minutes into city center which I did nearly daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment was extremely comfortable and I really appreciated the cushy bed and the room with big desk and office chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoyed staying here so much that I booked to stay again for another week after returning from the Greek islands.\n",
      "We booked Sokol’s apartment very last minute because we did not make it to our next destination in time. First off, #1 shower in Athens. Amazing beds, brand-newly renovated, convenient location, and best bang for your buck! It was a great value, and he was so nice to find the iPad that I left behind. We will be back!\n",
      "het appartement was erg schoon en was goed en mooi ingericht er stond een smart tv met netflix er op de keuken was goed ingericht en er was voldoende keuken gerei om mee te koken als we vragen hadden stond ira en haar collega altijd klaar om te helpen ze reageerde altijd snel als we vragen hadden buiten in de buurt zijn genoeg winkels en kiosk waar je je boodschappen cakejes coffee en dat soort dingen kan halen de metro was ook heel erg dicht bij. \n",
